1) How are Javascript files loaded?
    They are loaded in sequence unless marked with the async or defer attribute. If they have defer the defers are executed in order but async is unpredictable.
2) What is the DOM?
    Document Object Model. Documents are ordered like a tree.
3) What is AJAX?
    AJAX is a way to communicate with a server and exchange data so you can update the page or the server. It communicates using HTTP. It can be used asyncronously so it can happen in the background while the page loads. AJAX is that stuff we do when we do hhtpRequest.
